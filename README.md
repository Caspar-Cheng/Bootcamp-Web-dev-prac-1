# FrontEnd-Development-Practice
This repository is a collection of all the small front-end practice from me,
Mainly use: HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, jQuery

/- 1 - Dice Challenge: two players play dice and compare to show the result;

/- 2 - Drum Kit: insert images for 7 different pictures and link them with different instrumental sound;

/- 3 - Simon Game: user clicks same color as game chose(with four different color patterns and sound), if wrong game over and press any key to restart;
