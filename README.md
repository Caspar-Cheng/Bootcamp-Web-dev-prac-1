# FrontEnd-Development-Practice
this repository is a collection of all the small webpage practice from me.
/First one is Dice Challenge: two players play dice and compare to show the result;
/Second one is Drum Kit: insert images for 7 different pictures and link them with different instrumental sound;
/Third one is Simon Game: user clicks same color as game chose(with four different color patterns and sound), if wrong game over and press any key to restart;
